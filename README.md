# The Annotated Iterated Narration Corpus (AINC)

The AINC is a corpus of crime stories and retellings of it. We're working on a user-friendly interface and documentation right now, but feel free to already use it. You can download the csv file [here](https://github.com/elisakreiss/iteratednarration/corpus).

If you use our corpus, please cite us with the paper that introduced the collection of the stories and their annotations.
